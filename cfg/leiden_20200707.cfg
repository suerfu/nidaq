# Rules of config file for Polaris ConfigParser:

# 1) comments start with #.
# 2) parameter name and values cannot contain space.
# 3) directories can be nested and specified with curly brackets { }. The closing bracket must have white space before and after.
# 4) between parameter key and value there should be either colon or equal sign.
# 5) at the end of parameter value, there should be a comma.
# 6) arrays can be passed in: simply use space to separate each values.
